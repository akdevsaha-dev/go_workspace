package main

func main() {
	const age1 int = 30
	age2 := 25 // short hand declaration -- type inferred.
	if age1 > age2 {
		return true
	} else {
		return false
	}
}

Note the above code is wrong because-
You’re trying to return true or return false inside main(), but in Go:
	•	main() has no return type — it must not return anything.
	•	Returning values from main() causes a compilation error.

- For the corrected version of the code you can check main.go


//You can make the main.go code shorted by using the comparison directly.

``
package main

import "fmt"
                       
func main() {
	const age1 int = 30
	age2 := 25
	fmt.Println(age1 < age2)
}
